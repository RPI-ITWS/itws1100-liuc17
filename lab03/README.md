ITWS1100- Lab 3

My Personal Website: 

In this lab, I created a personal Intro to ITWS Website, and deployed it to my own personal web server. In my homepage, 
I added a short about me with a picture to introduce myself. I also included contact information so that users can contact me
for anything. I included a navigation bar to make the page look cleaner, and so that it is easy to access my information. 
In my Project/Labs tab, I included a text box with links to everything I did in that lab. I designed it this way because I felt like
this is the easiest way to access information. I also made sure to add very clear names to all the links so that the user knows
exactly what they are looking for on my website. Overall, my goal when designing this website is to make it look clean and minimalistic,
as well as being easy to navigate for users.
