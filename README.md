FULL LAB README



LAB 1 - AZURE SETUP

LAB 2 - RESUME


LAB 3 - PERSONAL WEBSITE 
9/23/24

In this lab, I created a personal Intro to ITWS Website, and deployed it to my own personal web server. In my homepage, 
I added a short about me with a picture to introduce myself. I also included contact information so that users can contact me
for anything. I included a navigation bar to make the page look cleaner, and so that it is easy to access my information. 
In my Project/Labs tab, I included a text box with links to everything I did in that lab. I designed it this way because I felt like
this is the easiest way to access information. I also made sure to add very clear names to all the links so that the user knows
exactly what they are looking for on my website. Overall, I designed my website to look really clean and minimalistic, but also efficient.

LAB 4 - XML & MICROFORMATS
9/30/24

For this lab, I learned how to create an RSS and Atom sheet using XML. For the RSS sheet, the articles that I provided were all
articles about the newest technologies of 2024. I find this topic really interesting, and I feel like it is a really relevant topic
for this class. In my Atom file, I linked the 2024-2025 RPI Academic Calendar for October. Doing this lab, I referenced the RSS and Atom
example file a lot, and I feel like I learned a lot about how xml files work. In the processing of creating my RSS, I also learned 
how to look through an HTML page source file for information such as publishing date. I found this lab really interesting overall.
