ITWS1100- Lab 3

My Personal Website: 

In this lab, I created a personal Intro to ITWS Website, and deployed it to my own personal web server. In my homepage, 
I added a short about me with a picture to introduce myself. I also included contact information so that users can contact me
for anything. I included a navigation bar to make the page look cleaner, and so that it is easy to access my information. 
In my Project/Labs tab, I included a text box with links to everything I did in that lab. I designed it this way because I felt like
this is the easiest way to access information. I also made sure to add very clear names to all the links so that the user knows
exactly what they are looking for on my website. Overall, I designed my website to look really clean and minimalistic, but also efficient.
