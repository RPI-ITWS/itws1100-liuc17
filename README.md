ITWS1100 - INTRO TO ITWS
ALL LAB README

LAB 1 - AZURE SETUP

LAB 2 - RESUME


LAB 3 - PERSONAL WEBSITE 
9/23/24

In this lab, I created a personal Intro to ITWS Website, and deployed it to my own personal web server. In my homepage, 
I added a short about me with a picture to introduce myself. I also included contact information so that users can contact me
for anything. I included a navigation bar to make the page look cleaner, and so that it is easy to access my information. 
In my Project/Labs tab, I included a text box with links to everything I did in that lab. I designed it this way because I felt like
this is the easiest way to access information. I also made sure to add very clear names to all the links so that the user knows
exactly what they are looking for on my website. Overall, I designed my website to look really clean and minimalistic, but also efficient.

LAB 4 - XML & MICROFORMATS
9/30/24

For this lab, I learned how to create an RSS and Atom sheet using XML. For the RSS sheet, the articles that I provided were all
articles about the newest technologies of 2024. I find this topic really interesting, and I feel like it is a really relevant topic
for this class. In my Atom file, I linked the 2024-2025 RPI Academic Calendar for October. Doing this lab, I referenced the RSS and Atom example file a lot, and I feel like I learned a lot about how xml files work. In the processing of creating my RSS, I also learned how to look through an HTML page source file for information such as publishing date. I found this lab really interesting overall. 

LAB 5 - JAVASCRIPT

LAB 6 - JQUERY
10/21/24
Through this lab, I learned a lot about how to use jQuery to make a website more interative for users. By solving the problems in the JS file, I got to practice directly modifying the DOM by changing text styles, and structures using methods like .hide(), .show(), .html(), etc. This helped me to understand how to dynamically update the UI based on user interactions. In addtion, using event listeners such as click() and event delegation with .on() I was able to make my web page even more interactive, and deal with dynamically added items. Overall, this lab taught me very practical skills for creating responsive and interactive web pages.
