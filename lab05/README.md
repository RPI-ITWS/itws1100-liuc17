In this lab, I learned how to utilize and connect the code in all three types of files: CSS, HTML & JavaScript. I found it
really interesting how the different types of code are used for different reasons, and work together to form the contents 
of a website. Through this project, I got to practice writing functions in JavaScript, and also learned how to use focus. Doing
this lab, I referenced w3schools, and geeksforgeeks often to try to find references on how to write the functions. Overall, I enjoyed using all three programs, and connecting the different files together to form a website.
